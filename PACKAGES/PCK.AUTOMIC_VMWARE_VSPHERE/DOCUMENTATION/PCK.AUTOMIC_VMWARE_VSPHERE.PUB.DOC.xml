================================
VMware Infrastructure is the industry's first full infrastructure virtualization suite that allows enterprises and small businesses alike to transform, manage and optimize their IT systems infrastructure through virtualization. With this package we automate the following modules through various actions:
* Manage Virtual Machines - Provision(also using Templates), Start, Stop, Restart, Suspend, Delete, Clone, Move VMs.
* Manage VM Snapshots - Create/Remove and Revert VM to snapshots. 
* Manage VM Hosts - Restart, Stop and Suspend.
* Manage Virtual Network - Create/Remove Host Network Adapters, Port Groups, Virtual Switch.
* Configuration - activate/deactivate DRS and DPM, set-up Maintenance for VMHost/Cluster.
* Manage Templates - Create Template and Convert VM to Templates.
* Management of Tasks - Stop Tasks in vCenter.
* Generic actions to Test capacity of Datastores, Get statistical info of vCenter Entities and Search entities like VM, VMHost, Clusters, Datacenter.

=Supported versions=
VMware vSphere PowerCLI version 6.0 , 6.3.0 and 6.5.0.

=Limitations=
* We are only supporting Windows Agent with PowerShell for VMware vSphere package.
* 'Folder path' field does not support sub-folder with the name "/". E.g If VM exists in a folder with the name "/" and we have provided full folder path like  'Spartan/vm//' then in this case action would fail.  

=Setup=
* Oracle JDK 1.7 or higher must be installed on Agent OS and "java" must be set as executable on the same.

* The Agent should be able to access the vCenter servers in order to make HTTP requests.

* Windows Management Framework 4.0 (includes Windows PowerShell) must be installed on the Agent OS.
