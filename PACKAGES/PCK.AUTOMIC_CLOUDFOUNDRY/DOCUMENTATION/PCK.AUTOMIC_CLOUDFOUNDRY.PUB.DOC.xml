================================
Cloud Foundry is an open source cloud computing platform optimized to deliver fast application development and deployment in a highly scalable architecture. With this package we automate the following modules through various actions:
* Application Management - Deploy, Start, Stop or Delete Applications on Cloud Foundry
* Services Management - Create, Delete services and Bind/ Unbind them with applications
* Management of Domain and Route - Create Domains and Map/ Unmap Routes

=Supported versions=
CF CLI version 6.14.1
 
=Limitations=

=Setup=
* Oracle JDK 1.7 or higher must be installed on Agent OS and "java" must be set as executable on the same.

* The Agent should be able to access the Cloud Foundry URL(s) in order to make HTTP requests.

* CF CLI tool version 6.14.1 or higher must be installed on the Agent machine and set as an executable.

* Action Name: PCK.AUTOMIC_CLOUDFOUNDRY.PUB.ACTION.PUSH_APPLICATION
* Action Description: This action is used to push an application to Cloud Foundry for the user associated to the provided authentication token. It allows a user to deploy a single application to Cloud Foundry or deploy multiple application using a manifest file.

* Action Name: PCK.AUTOMIC_CLOUDFOUNDRY.PUB.ACTION.DELETE_APPLICATION
* Action Description: This action is used to delete an application in Cloud Foundry. This action will not fail even if specified application doesn?t exist in Cloud Foundry.
