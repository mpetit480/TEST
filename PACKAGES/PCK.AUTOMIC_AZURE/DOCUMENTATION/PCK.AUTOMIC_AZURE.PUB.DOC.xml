=Actions=

Following actions are supported for Azure.

* Action Name: PCK.AUTOMIC_AZURE.PUB.ACTION.GET_SUBSCRIPTION_INFO
Action Description: This action is used to fetch Subscription details from Azure system as per the specified Subscription Id. We also need to specify the path to authentication certificate (keystore .jks file) and certificate password in order to connect to Azure system. The Output of this action will be an XML printed in the Job report containing detailed information of the specified Azure Subscription.

* Action name: PCK.AUTOMIC_AZURE.PUB.ACTION.CHANGE_VM_STATE
Action description: This action is used to change the virtual machine state (start , restart , shutdown and shutdown & deallocate). Difference between shutdown and shutdown deallocate is that later will release all the resources acquired by the Virtual machine. This action will return request id which can be further used to query the status of the action.

* Action name: PCK.AUTOMIC_AZURE.PUB.ACTION.CHECK_REQUEST_STATUS
Action description: This action is used to fetch the status of a previously submitted Azure request based on the request id provided by the user. The request status is stored and published in an AE variable. The value of request status will be either Succeeded, InProgress or Failed. This action will fail if the user provides an invalid request id which does not exist in the Azure system.

* Action name: PCK.AUTOMIC_AZURE.PUB.ACTION.DELETE_VM
Action description: This action is used to delete the given virtual machine in the cloud service. The action will return the request id which can be further queried to get the status of this action. Also, if delete attached media is selected YES then it will delete all the associated media (operating system disk.data disk and the source blobs) not the container.

* Action name: PCK.AUTOMIC_AZURE.PUB.ACTION.CREATE_VM_DEPLOYMENT
Action description: The Create Virtual Machine Deployment Action creates a deployment and then creates a Virtual Machine in that deployment based on the provided XML configuration file and service name. If action executed successfully, it will return request status id that will be used to check the status of the executed action.

* Action name: PCK.AUTOMIC_AZURE.PUB.ACTION.CREATE_STORAGE_CONTAINER

* Action Name: PCK.AUTOMIC_AZURE.PUB.ACTION.PUT_BLOB
Action Description: The Put Blob action uploads a new block blob. The content of the existing blob is overwritten with the content of the new blob and overwrites any existing metadata on the blob. Partial updates are not supported with Put Blob. The default MIME type is application/octet-stream. Using this action user can save his/her contents(images, videos, documents etc.) in the form of blob for future usage. This action will also publish the blob name in AE variable on successful upload.
