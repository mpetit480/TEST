=Supported versions=

See https://docs.automic.com/tools/compatibility_matrix

To Execute Check Disk Space and Delete Folder Content over SSH and WinRM. SSH and WinRM should be enabled on Target Machine.

=Supported versions=
Powershell 4.0 or later

=Setup=

In order to enable WinRM, please follow the below steps on the target system.

Configure WinRM with default settings over HTTP
1. Run the command using command prompt: Winrm quickconfig
	You must run this command as an administrator.

2. When the tool displays Make these changes [y/n]?, Press y.
	If the configuration is successful, the following output will be displayed:	

	WinRM has been updated for remote management.
	WinRM service type changed to delayed auto start.
	WinRM service started.
	Created a WinRM listener on HTTP://* to accept WS-Man requests to any IP on this machine.

3. Keep the default settings for client and server components of WinRM, or customize them. For example, you might need to add certain remote computers to the client configuration Trusted Hosts list. A trusted hosts list should be set up when mutual authentication cannot be established. Kerberos allows mutual authentication, but it cannot be used in workgroups, only domains. A best practice for setting up trusted hosts for a workgroup is to make the list should be as restricted as possible.
OR
   Configure the remote Windows machine for Basic authentication with custom settings. Run the following commands.
	setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion EnableExtensions
	title Configuring Windows Remote Management...
 
	cmd /c net stop winrm
	cmd /c winrm quickconfig -q
	cmd /c winrm quickconfig -transport:http
	cmd /c winrm set winrm/config @{MaxTimeoutms="1800000"}
	cmd /c winrm set winrm/config/winrs @{MaxMemoryPerShellMB="2048"}
        cmd /c winrm set winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted="true"}
	cmd /c winrm set winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic="true"}
	cmd /c winrm set winrm/config/listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTP @{Port="5985"}
	cmd /c sc config winrm start= auto
	cmd /c net start winrm

	cmd /c netsh firewall set service type=remoteadmin mode=enable
	cmd /c netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group="remote administration" new enable=yes
	cmd /c netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Port 5985" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5985

Configure WinRM over HTTPS
1. Create an HTTPS listener by running the following command.
        winrm quickconfig -transport:https. 
              You must open port 5986 for HTTPS transport to work.

2. Next step is to create a certificate on the target machine that has FQDN as the hostname. For that, run a PowerShell cmdlet on that machine.
        New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName ssrmdvm3.southeastasia.cloudapp.azure.com -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\My
	         Above command will create a self-signed certificate for testing purposes. The output of the command will show a thumbprint of the certificate. That thumbprint 
                 is a 40 digit number.	
	OR
        You can also create a self-signed certificate for the remote host by installing selfssl.exe usinf IIS 6 resource kit
	(http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=17275) and run the command as mentioned by reference 
	(http://www.hansolav.net/blog/SelfsignedSSLCertificatesOnIIS7AndCommonNames.aspx).

3. Open a PowerShell window and enter the following command to find the thumbprint for the certificate for the remote host:
	Get-childItem cert:\LocalMachine\Root\ | Select-String -pattern <HOSTNAME>

5. Delete the existing WinRM listener that is linked to SSL certificate with IP address and create a new listener that is linked to FQDN.
    To do so, you need to execute two cmdlets in succession:
	* winrm delete winrm/config/listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTPS
	* winrm create winrm/config/listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTPS '@{Hostname="vviespartan03.sbb01.spoc.global"; CertificateThumbprint="Copy the thumbprint from earlier cmdlet output";port="5986"}'
	E.g. winrm create winrm/config/listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTPS             
                                '@{Hostname="vviespartan03.sbb01.spoc.global";CertificateThumbprint="A588F550237477242C3D91649105CB7DD18AFD46";port="5986"}'

6. You can check the configured listeners of WinRM by running the following command.
		winrm e winrm/config/listeners
